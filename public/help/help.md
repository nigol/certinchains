### Introduction

CertInChains application shows the certificate chain of any HTTPS site. You can copy certificates to the ```.cer``` files.

### Usage

Enter the URL into the input field and press button **Show**. Certificate chain is then displayed under the URL box. Root certificate is not displayed, because it is stored in browser's local storage and therefore not transmitted.
